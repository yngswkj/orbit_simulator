
Plan:
1. Fix `CelestialBody.tsx` logic to ensure Earth is Terrestrial and Venus/Mercury are Rocky (or Venusian).
2. Enhance `ProceduralPlanet.tsx`:
    - **Rocky**: Add atmosphere (thin, dusty) for Mars. Add normal mapping details.
    - **Ice**: Add subsurface scattering simulation (better than current).
    - **Molten**: Improve flow animation.
    - **Tetrestrial**: Improve clouds/atmosphere.
    - **Gas Giant**: Add more turbulence/storms.
3. Test by adding custom bodies or using the preview.
